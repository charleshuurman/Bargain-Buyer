# Gas Station Locator Web App

## Description

The "Gas Station Locator Web App" is designed to assist users in finding gas stations, along with the current gas prices. 

- **Motivation**: The constant changes of gas prices and the necessity of finding gas stations in unfamiliar areas motivated us to create this user-friendly app.
- **Purpose**: We built this application to provide users with an easy and efficient way to locate gas stations and get the most up-to-date pricing information.
- **Problem Solved**: This app eliminates the hassle of manually searching for gas stations and checking multiple sources for price information.
- **What We Learned**: 
-   Integrating multiple APIs,
-   Team work,
-   Creating a wireframe in Miro that allows us to visualize were we are going, 
-   Using GitHub as a team to update content and coordinate.
-   Enhancing user experience with real-time data.
